# VPS Package Installer

This repository contains a set of scripts for installing various packages on your VPS (Virtual Private Server). The installer comes in four versions:

- PackageXXS.sh
- PackageXS.sh
- PackageS.sh
- PackageM.sh

These scripts are created by LegendaryNodes.

## Usage

1. Open your terminal and use `nano` to create or edit a new file with the desired package name:

```bash
nano YourPackageName.sh
```

2. Paste the content of the package file into the text editor.

3. Save the file and exit `nano` (usually by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, and then `Enter`).

4. Execute the package installer script using `bash`:

```bash
bash YourPackageName.sh
```

Make sure to replace `YourPackageName.sh` with the actual name of the package file you've created or downloaded.
